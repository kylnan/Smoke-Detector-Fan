# Smoke Detector Fan

This is the start of an embedded project I want to build on further and see how much more advanced I can make it
Right now all I have is a few sensors, an esp32, and a relay hooked up to your average box fan. I wanted to build this so I could have an automatic exhaust fan when cooking food.

~### Wifi Implementation?
Next steps are to have the sensors moved closer to the stove (right under the microwave) and have two esp32s communicate over wifi.~

## ESP-NOW Protocol.
Need to look into implementation

### RTOS implementation?
After that (although I feel this may be overkill), I was wondering if implementing it with RTOS would be good.

Here is a rough first build (looks bad I know)
